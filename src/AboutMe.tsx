					<p>As an accomplished Android developer with a strong affinity for
						Kotlin, I've immersed myself in an array of exciting projects that showcase my
						expertise. While Android development is my primary focus, I'm always eager to explore
						other platforms like iOS, Flutter, and React.
					</p>
					<p>Whether I'm diving into Android and Kotlin or experimenting with React and JavaScript,
						the joy I find in coding knows no bounds. I'm an eternal student,
						constantly seeking new knowledge. Most of my days are spent programming, but I also
						make sure to carve out time to enjoy the company of my wonderful girlfriend, Maty,
						and our two adorable cats, Barb and Sox.</p>

					<p>My journey into software development began after pursuing a degree in
						audio engineering at the University of Central Oklahoma. Eight years later, I discovered
						the captivating world of software development. Although I've
						been programming for nearly two years, my passion and dedication have accelerated my
						growth. I dedicate around six hours each day to programming because,
						I find it incredibly enjoyable and fulfilling.</p>
					<p>Currently, I am working as a Software QA Tester in the Accessibility Department at
						Quality Logic, but my heart is set on transitioning into software development. While I'm
						primarily self-taught, I did spend a few months in school pursuing a computer science
						degree. Surprisingly, I already possessed a solid foundation in many of the concepts
						covered, including basic data structures and algorithms.</p>
